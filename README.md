# Task #5 - Database interface

This assignment aims at further strengthening our scripting skills and working more closely with a database.

In this assignment you will work with your group to modify your data collection script so that it interfaces with a database. 

You will take the questionnaire that you developed in your group and make a new version of it that interfaces with a MySQL database. 

## Skillsets

You will be exposed to the following skillsets;

1. Scripting user input (this comes from your original script)
2. Writing to temporary files
3. Scripting database interface

## Expectations

I expect you and your team to develop a script, based on your last one, that will allow you to write the information gathered into a MySQL database instead of into a CSV file as the final output form. 

## Prerequisites
You will need Bash, text files, and MySQL, all of which are available in CodeAnywhere.

## Instructions

You will need to do the following for this assignment to be considered complete. 

*As a team:*

1. Make a branch with an archived version of your first questionnaire script.
2. Create a database that has the appropriate variables and variable types (this might be an accessory script or a conditional statement in your script)
3. Modify your script to do the following:
  - connect to a MySQL database (HINT: this will involve setting variables for MySQL username, password, and location)
  - enter the data input by users into a MySQL database 
  - dump the MySQL database into a .sql file in your repository directory with the rest of your files after it has been modified with nex data

*Individually:*

1. Write a blog post that links to your fork of your team's repository.
